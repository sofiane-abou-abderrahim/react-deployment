# Deploying React Apps

## From Development To Production

- Deployment Steps & Pitfalls
  1. Test Code: Manually & with automated tests
  2. Optimize Code: Optimize user experience & performance
     1. Lazy Loading: Load code only when it's needed
     2. Having to load all the code initially will slow down that initial page load
  3. Build App: Run build process to parse, transform & optimize code
  4. Upload App: Upload production code to hosting server
  5. Configure Server: Ensure app is served securely & as intended
- Server-side Routing vs Client-side Routing
